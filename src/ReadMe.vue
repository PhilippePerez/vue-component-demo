    <p>The main goal is to provide all the widgets that are usually needed to develop a back-office application.</p>
    <p>The next todo is to fix a packaging bug which breaks the UI ( all styles gone ) , i just saw that when releasing because locally it was fine</p>
    <p>Then i will write a demo project , more than 'hello' world i am planning to write a user administration app ( with mocked back-end )</p>
    <p>This library is still in beta version !</p>
