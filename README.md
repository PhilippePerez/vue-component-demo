# A Vue.js Library for Back-Office Applications

## Goal

Delivering a clean, efficient, and no-fuss solution for your back-office applications.

## Background

Businesses often rely on numerous small to medium-sized applications to support their operations. These applications require simple yet highly productive UIs to maximize efficiency and usability.

Having built many such applications over the years, I decided to consolidate my experience into this library. It is actively used in my personal projects, prototypes, and more. [The showcase application](https://vuewidgets.com/) itself is built using this library.

## Getting Started

You can explore the full source code for the showcase application on [GitHub](https://github.com/your-repository-link).
